# Numpy-like C++ Tensor Class for Basic Deep Learning Operations

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a lightweight and efficient deep learning inference library tailored for Arm64 devices. Inspired by the simplicity and functionality of NumPy, our goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for performing fundamental deep learning operations in C++, optimized specifically for Arm64 architecture.
